An issue was discovered in disable_priv_mode in shell.c in GNU Bash through 5.0 
patch 11. By default  if Bash is run with its effective UID not equal to its 
real UID  it will drop privileges by setting its effective UID to its real UID. 
However  it does so incorrectly. On Linux and other systems that support saved 
UID functionality  the saved UID is not dropped. An attacker with command 
execution in the shell can use enable -f for runtime loading of a new builtin  
which can be a shared object that calls setuid() and therefore regains 
privileges. However  binaries running with an effective UID of 0 are unaffected.
